          <h3>Who?</h3>
          <p>
            Hey. I'm Simão Ponce de Leão Policarpo Nogueira.
            <br>
            I like <i>web stuff.</i> Always have.
            <br>
            Currently studying <i>design</i> @ FCTUC, <i>designing</i>
            for <a href="#">jeK</a> and for <a href="#">Pink Room</a> and
            for <i>myself.</i>
          </p>

          <br>
          <h3>What?</h3>
          <p>
            Sorry, I'll explain.
            <br>
            19 years old, born and raised in Coimbra. I like <i class="crossed">art</i>
            <i class="crossed">beautiful things</i> <i class="crossed">estética</i>
            <i class="crossed">nada</i> <i>things that make me feel a certain way.</i>
            <br>
            I also enjoy music (<i>send Spotify Playlists</i>).
          </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>What do you really want?</h3>
          <p>
            <i>Eveything</i>.
            <br>
            No. Yes. Not really.
            <br>
            I want to <i>learn</i> about everything, and I want to <i>do</i> everything,
            and I want to be happy and to travel and to meet people and to see things.
            <br>
            But I mostly want to learn. Is this all learning?
          </p>

        <article>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>How bad do you really want it?</h3>
          <p>Bad.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Why should I give you what you want?</h3>
          <p>
            Should you really? No one gives anyone anything.
            <br>
            I'll trade my time and dedication for any seemingly good opportunity,
            even if that means I have to travel all the way across the world... <i>oh no
            ... please... don't make me do it... everything but travelling.</i>
            <br>
            On a serious note,
            <br>
            I've done a cool couple of things, worked with a cool couple of people,
            in a cool couple of places. Look below.

            to work, and to work you have to learn... checks out?

              The Student's Association was a great way to learn how to work,
              Whitesmith to learn what it means to work (so hard to keep it to
              just a few words), and jeKnowledge to learn how to f*ck things up.

            Here's a short list of things I've done.
            <br>
            There's a lot more, but it's a lot easier to share websites than other types of project.
            <br>
            I'll share those upon request.

      <h3>It was nice having you.</h3>
      <p>
        Hope some of this info was what you were looking for.
        <br>
        Though I'm not actively looking for a new job, I am always searching
        for cool stuff to do. Hit me up if your company could be interested
        in whatever it may be I have to offer. Hit me up if you wanna talk design
        and music and work. Hit me up if you're a startup from a cool place and you'd
        like me to visit. Hit me up if you know of a nice event. Hit me up if you have
        a summer internship (yes, this. I am looking for something extra to do in the
        summer.).
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always available.
